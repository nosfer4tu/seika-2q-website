# seika-2q-website

I had to create a project for an assignment, using javascript libraries but I didn't know what to build, so I've built something that shows which colognes I have used until now / currently using.
I have used typed.js, AOS ( animate on scroll), swiper.js and particles.js for my project. With these libraries, I have improved this its appearance, making it a little more stylish website.
